<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

My project is about an English Examination system which targets students who are willing to examine their English knowledge by answering some questions, each time you will receive different questions and you are not only receiving the questions, but also you can listen to it's pronounciation in case you don't know it, at the end of the test you will receive your final score.



### Built With
In this project I tented to used different libraries to implement my idea in a proper way, First off I used React.js as a frame work to implement the SPA priciples, I also implemented system design by using material ui and I tented to use TypeScript to write more Typed , organised and clean code.

Regarding the server side I used Node.js and MongoDB to make the database and api's.
